    "text": "The God Eros in Greek mythology is often related to Love and Beauty, but the truth is Eros was also mundane. His favorite hobby was descending to Earth with one goal in mind, exploring Human sexuality. Eros Unlimited Production desires to enlighten the World of forbidden pleasures, taboos, ambiguous non-conformist genders and sexuality with a different eye, an unique angle. We hope You enjoy Eros and let him hit you with his arrow of Love."
